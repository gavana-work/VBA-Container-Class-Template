# VBA-Container-Class-Template
A convenient data structure for complex tasks in Excel, or any other Microsoft Office Application.

### Purpose
If you're in the position of maintaining legacy VB tools or you have any complex personal tasks in any Microsoft Office program you've come to the right place.

Here you will find a template which serves as a simple example of class types that can own other class types.
This method of organizing data is the only way to have object oriented programming with VB.

### Note
Written for a 64-bit System with VB7.
I cannot take credit for the actual method. This is only my rendition.
