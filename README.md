# VBA-Container-Class-Template
A convenient data structure for complex tasks in Excel, or any other Microsoft Office Application!

//PURPOSE
I hope this template can serve as a simple example of class types that can own other class types.
This method of organizing data is very useful when your data is related in a "list of lists of lists..." pattern.

//DISCLAIMER
Written for a 64-bit System with VB7.
I cannot take credit for the actual method. This is only my rendition.
